/* 
Part 1: Java Programming
Problem Description
Write a Java Swing application. 
•	You may find some online tutorial to learn to use the “Code With Me” plugins inside IntelliJ. 
    This allows the team to code together on your project remotely.
•	You may find some online tutorial to learn to use the Swing UI Designer inside IntelliJ. 
    This allows you to create GUI designs easier.
•	The application as shown below includes a user-defined JFrame object, a user-defined JPanel object, and a JButton.
•	The JPanel should have a paintComponent(Graphics g) method, which can draw background 10 x 10 grids, and draw lines of random colors and lengths (line thickness be 10f). 
    Use class Line2D.Double and method draw of class Graphics2D to draw the lines;
•	Every time user clicks the Redraw button, the program should randomly redraw the lines again.
